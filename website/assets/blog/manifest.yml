    title: Intro to D metaprogramming - Creating a JSON serialiser
    description: |
      A series which covers the creation of a basic JSON serialiser in D
      while teaching several different aspects of D's metaprogramming: templates;
      template arguments; function contracts; static if; static foreach; mixins, and more.

    title: Metaprogramming In D
    description: |
      D boasts one of the strongest, most flexible array of metaprogramming features amongst most existing languages,
      which allows it the ability to perform use-cases such as automating boilerplate without the need
      of external tooling; generating compiler optimised D code from a regex at compile-time; and running functions at compile-time
      to generate values/more code. All done using the language's built-in features with little compromise.
